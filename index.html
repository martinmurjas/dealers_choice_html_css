      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Imagine your perfect summer getaway: rolling hills, distant peaks,
        glistening water, and a gorgeous town in the heart of it all. That's
        Lake Placid. Whether you're hiking through the mountains or walking
        through town, this is then place to invent your own perfect day.
      </p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Lake Placid was founded in the early 19th century to develop an iron ore
        mining operation. By 1840, the population of "North Elba" (four miles
        southeast of the present village, near where the road to the Adirondak
        Loj crosses the Ausable River), was six families. In 1845, the
        philanthropist Gerrit Smith arrived in North Elba and not only bought a
        great deal of land around the village but granted large tracts to former
        slaves. He reformed the land law and demonstrated his support of
        abolitionism.
        <br /><br />
        The abolitionist John Brown heard about Smith's reforms, and left his
        anti-slavery activities in Kansas to buy 244 acres (1.0 km2) of land in
        North Elba. This parcel later became known as the "Freed Slave Utopian
        Experiment," Timbuctoo. Shortly before his execution in 1859, John Brown
        asked to be buried on his farm, preserved as the John Brown Farm State
        Historic Site.
        <br /><br />
        As leisure time increased in the late 19th century, Lake Placid was
        discovered as a resort by the wealthy, drawn to the fashionable Lake
        Placid Club. Melvil Dewey, who invented the Dewey Decimal System,
        designed what was then called "Placid Park Club" in 1895. This inspired
        the village to change its name to Lake Placid, an incorporated village
        in 1900. Dewey kept the club open through the winter in 1905, which
        aided the development of winter sports in the area. Nearby Saranac Lake
        had hosted an international winter sporting event as early as 1889 and
        was used year-round by patients seeking treatment for tuberculosis at
        sanatoria. The fresh, clean mountain air was considered good for them
        and was a common treatment for tuberculosis.
        <br /><br />
        By 1921, the Lake Placid area could boast a ski jump, speed skating
        venue, and ski association. In 1929, Dr. Godfrey Dewey, Melvil's son,
        convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Lake Placid had the
        best winter sports facilities in the United States. The Lake Placid Club
        was the headquarters for the IOC for the 1932 and the 1980 Winter
        Olympics in Lake Placid.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to the John Brown Farm and Gravesite, the Mount Van
        Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run, New York Central Railroad Adirondack
        Division Historic District, and United States Post Office are listed on
        the National Register of Historic Places.[5]

      <h2>Olympic Games</h2>

          Lake Placid hosted the Winter Olympics in 1932 and 1980. During the
          1932 games, the trails outside of the village served for the
          cross-country skiing events and the cross-country skiing part of the
          Nordic combined event. Lake Placid, St Moritz, and Innsbruck are the
          only sites to have twice hosted the Winter Olympic Games.
          <br /><br />
          Jack Shea, a resident of the village, became the first person to win
          two gold medals when he doubled in speed skating at the 1932 Winter
          Olympics. He carried the Olympic torch through Lake Placid in 2002
          shortly before his death. His grandson, Jimmy Shea, competed in the
          2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, in his honor, winning
          gold in the Skeleton.
          <br /><br />
          In the U.S., the village is especially remembered as the 1980 USA–USSR
          hockey game site. Dubbed the "Miracle on Ice", a group of American
          college students and amateurs upset seasoned and professional Soviet
          national ice hockey team, 4–3, and two days later won the gold medal.
          Another high point during the Games was the performance of American
          speed-skater Eric Heiden, who won five gold medals.
          <br /><br />
          Lake Placid was interested in bidding for the 2016 Winter Youth
          Olympics but decided against it; Lillehammer, Norway was the only
          bidder and was awarded the games. Lake Placid shifted its interest
          toward bidding for the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics, but it again did
          not submit a bid.

      <h2>Lakes</h2>

          Lake Placid offers great, sometimes record-breaking, fishing for
          anglers looking for a fun outing in the High Peaks. You'll find a
          variety of fish, including Rainbow, Brook, and Lake Trout, Smallmouth
          and Rock Bass, Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed, and Brown Bullhead. Boaters
          can launch their watercraft from a hard surface ramp at the southern
          end of the lake. <br /><br />
          Nestled just south of Lake Placid's waters is Mirror Lake. The main
          stretch of the Village of Lake Placid actually runs alongside the
          smaller lake's western shore. Anglers can fish for Lake and Rainbow
          Trout, Smallmouth and Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Perch, and Brown
          Bullhead. Visitors to Mirror Lake can only launch their boats by hand,
          and while gas motors are not allowed, electric ones are.
          <br /><br />
          Nestled along Route 73 on the climb to Lake Placid, Lower Cascade Lake
          provides an excellent area to paddle in the shadow of some of the
          majestic High Peaks. There is a launch site for non-motorized boats,
          and anglers can expect to catch Brook and Brown Trout.

          At 4’867 feet, Whiteface Mountain is the fifth highest peak in New
          York and one of the most iconic mountains in the Adirondacks! The
          trail to the top of Whiteface is 5.0 miles, climbing steeply over
          rocky (and often times very muddy) terrain. This strenuous hike is
          often paired with Esther Mountain, as part of the 46 Adirondack High
          Peaks. <br /><br />
          Looking for more of a leisurely stroll than a strenuous hike? Then
          this one’s for you! Cobble Lookout is a relatively new hike near Lake
          Placid, located only 20 minutes north of the town center, in the
          Wilmington Wild Forest. Cobble Lookout is one of the easiest hikes on
          this list, and the views at the end are so stunning that it’s almost
          hard to believe how little effort it takes to get there.
          <br /><br />
          Up for a bit of a challenge? Why not tackle Mount Marcy? Not only is
          Mount Marcy one of the best hikes near Lake Placid, but it’s also the
          tallest mountain in New York.The views from the summit of Mount Marcy
          are some of the best in the northeast, but at 5,344 feet, Mount Marcy
          is a challenging hike that should only be attempted by experienced
          hikers.
          <br /><br />
          If you’re up for the challenge, conquering this mountain is an all day
          affair! The shortest route to the summit is from the Adirondack Loj
          Parking Area. From here, the 7.4 mile trail starts off deceivingly
          easy as it approaches the former Marcy Dam, before ascending over
          varied terrain to the bald summit. After a 7.4 mile trek, you’re
          rewarded for all of your efforts with 360-degree views of the vast
          Adirondack wilderness from the highest vantage point in New York
          State.
